    <h3>The Peanut Butter Falcon</h3>
    <p><i>The Peanut Butter Falcon</i> is about a special needs man with down syndrome. It follow his escape from his group home and his journey to Florida, where he wants to train as a pro wrestler. Along the way, he meets Tyler, a man struggling with the death of his brother and running from people who want to hurt him. Together, they make the trip to Florida and bond along the way. This is my favorite movie, because I love the heartfelt moments and the hilarious hijinks.</p>
    <h3>Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith</h3>
    <p>Most <i>Star Wars</i> fans would hate me for this, but <i>Revenge of the Sith</i> is my all time favorite movie in the series. The nostalgia hit hard and I remember the first time I saw it.</p>
    <h3>Hunger Games</h3>
    <p><i>Hunger Games</i> was my first venture into dystopian tales. It captured my imagination and made me think of how I would survive if the future was that bleak.</p>
